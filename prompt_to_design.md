You will operate as a deep-thinking AI, carefully considering my requests. You will utilize long chains of thought, engage in systematic reasoning, deliberate on various options, explore implementation details where necessary, and perform validation checks before providing a final response. Your internal monologue detailing this process will be enclosed within <think> tags, followed by the conclusive answer or output. You will apply the following thorough methodology to achieve this:

You shall adopt the persona of a "deep-thinking AI". This means you need to explicitly demonstrate your reasoning process before providing the final answer. The key elements required are:

4.  *Deliberation & Option Exploration:* you must consider multiple possibilities, approaches, or interpretations before settling on one. This includes evaluating pros and cons if applicable.
5.  *Implementation Planning (if applicable):* For tasks involving creation (like code), you need to think through the implementation details and options.
6.  *Validation:* you should include steps for double-checking my reasoning, facts, or code before finalizing the output.
7.  *Formatting:* All this internal thinking process must be enclosed within <think> </think> tags.
8.  *Final Answer:* The actual response to the user should come after the closing </think> tag.
9.  *Context Awareness:* you need to keep in mind the provided current time and location (United States) for any relevant queries.

your main landing page (for a top luxury brand e-commerce site specializing in retailing top quality beauty, scent/aromatherapy products using the best natural ingredients) looks too simple, lacks a Day ↔ Night toggle with a richer, high-contrast palette, and 3D-style buttons. your attempt at landing page generation is far below my expectation - the color and contrast scheme is horrible looking, the page lacks some important sections that a top luxury brand retail website typically has, the fonts look ugly, lack animations, buttons too simple and so on. you should try to design for an actual luxury brand retail website. can you give your best shot one more time?

You have done an awesome job so far! Now, using your latest landing page as your design guide, help me to create a very detailed technical design specification document to build an actual modular, secure, and extensible e-commerce platform focused on delivering premium aromatherapy products. Your design document should specify how to build/code the actual dynamic platform engineered with a custom PHP MVC-inspired architecture (Apache + PHP v8.3 + Laravel v12 + MariaDB v11.7 + Tailwind CSS) without reliance on heavy frameworks, maximizing transparency and developer control. Your detailed technical design document should include a detailed project file structure with actual filenames for key .php files in /css, /images, /videos, /includes, /views, /views/layout, /models, and /controllers folders. All the project parameters values (e.g., MySQL login details) should be localized in /config.php, and all code files should go through /includes/db.php for database access. The design document should be detailed enough such that even a junior developer can complete the building of suchan  e-commerce platform without much doubt. Your document should have at least 5000 words.

awesome job so far! now help me create an attractive, yet detailed (3000 words) GitHub README.md for a github repo to house the project for the e-commerce platform whose technical blueprint you have just produced. The README.md should include a description of the website from the visitors perspective, an overview of the design ideas, concepts, etc, follow by technical details of the actual platform. The README.md should be detailed, technical and yet appropriately style to attract people to praise the project for its fantastic concepts and ideas. most people should be able to appreciate the README.md
